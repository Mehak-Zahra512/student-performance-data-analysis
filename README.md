# Student Performance and Risk Analysis
## Objective
The objective of this project is to analyze student academic performance and risk levels based on study habits, attendance, sleep patterns, and social media usage, and to evaluate how these factors influence final academic results.

## Dataset Description
The dataset consists of records of approximately 70–78 students. Each student is assigned a unique Student ID. The dataset includes the following variables:

- Student ID  
- Study time per day (hours)  
- Attendance percentage  
- Sleep time per day (hours)  
- Social media usage time (hours)  
- Previous CGPA  
- Risk score  
- Risk level (Low / Medium / High)  
- Final result (Pass / Fail)

## Tools Used
- Microsoft Excel

## Methodology
The following steps were performed in this project:
1. Data entry and organization using unique student identifiers
2. Cleaning and structuring of the dataset
3. Analysis of study habits, attendance, sleep time, and social media usage
4. Calculation and interpretation of risk scores and risk levels
5. Evaluation of the relationship between risk level and final academic result

## Results
The analysis indicated that students with higher study time, sufficient sleep, and better attendance generally showed lower risk levels and higher pass rates. In contrast, higher social media usage and lower attendance were associated with increased academic risk.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates the use of basic data analysis techniques to assess academic risk and performance. It highlights how multiple behavioral and academic factors can be combined to support early identification of at-risk students.
